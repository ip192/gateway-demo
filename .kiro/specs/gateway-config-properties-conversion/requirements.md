# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting the gateway-service configuration files from YAML format to properties format to standardize configuration management across the microservices architecture. Currently, the gateway-service uses multiple YAML configuration files (application.yml, application-dynamic-routing.yml, application-circuit-breaker.yml, application-performance.yml) which should be consolidated and converted to properties format for better consistency with other services in the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all gateway-service configuration files converted from YAML to properties format, so that configuration management is consistent across all microservices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the gateway-service starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from properties files instead of YAML files
2. WHEN configuration is read THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN multiple configuration profiles are used THEN they SHALL be properly supported in properties format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consolidated configuration files, so that configuration management is simplified and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration files are converted THEN the number of configuration files SHALL be minimized while maintaining profile separation
2. WHEN configuration is organized THEN related settings SHALL be grouped logically using properties naming conventions
3. WHEN configuration profiles are used THEN they SHALL follow Spring Boot properties profile conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Spring Cloud Gateway routes properly configured in properties format, so that routing functionality works identically to the current YAML configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routes are defined in properties THEN all existing route configurations SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN predicates are configured THEN they SHALL maintain the same path matching behavior
3. WHEN filters are applied THEN circuit breaker and retry configurations SHALL work identically
4. WHEN route metadata is specified THEN timeout, enabled status, and order SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Resilience4j circuit breaker configurations converted to properties format, so that fault tolerance features continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN circuit breaker instances are configured THEN all existing parameters SHALL be preserved in properties format
2. WHEN time limiter configurations are set THEN timeout durations SHALL remain the same
3. WHEN circuit breaker health indicators are enabled THEN monitoring functionality SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want management endpoints and monitoring configurations in properties format, so that operational monitoring capabilities are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN management endpoints are configured THEN all exposed endpoints SHALL remain accessible
2. WHEN health check configurations are set THEN detailed health information SHALL still be available
3. WHEN metrics configurations are applied THEN performance monitoring SHALL continue to function

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want HTTP client configurations converted to properties format, so that connection and timeout settings are properly maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP client settings are configured THEN connection timeouts SHALL remain the same
2. WHEN response timeouts are set THEN they SHALL maintain the same values
3. WHEN connection pool settings are configured THEN performance characteristics SHALL be preserved
