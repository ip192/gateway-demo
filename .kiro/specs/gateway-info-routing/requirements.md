# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements intelligent routing for the `/info` endpoint in the Spring Cloud Gateway service. The gateway will analyze request parameters to determine which backend service to route to based on the `id` parameter prefix, while maintaining existing routing rules for all other endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to call a single `/info` endpoint on the gateway with an id parameter, so that the request is automatically routed to the appropriate backend service based on the id prefix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to `/info` with parameter `{"id":"user-123"}` THEN the gateway SHALL route the request to the user-service
2. WHEN a request is made to `/info` with parameter `{"id":"product-456"}` THEN the gateway SHALL route the request to the product-service
3. WHEN a request is made to `/info` without an id parameter THEN the gateway SHALL return an error response
4. WHEN a request is made to `/info` with an id parameter that doesn't match known prefixes THEN the gateway SHALL return an error response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the existing routing configuration to remain unchanged for all non-info endpoints, so that current functionality is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to any endpoint other than `/info` THEN the gateway SHALL use the existing configuration-based routing rules
2. WHEN the custom routing filter is active THEN it SHALL NOT interfere with existing route predicates and filters
3. WHEN the system starts up THEN both custom routing and configuration-based routing SHALL be active simultaneously

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing logic to be implemented using WebFilter interface, so that it integrates properly with Spring Cloud Gateway's reactive architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the routing logic THEN it SHALL use the WebFilter interface
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the filter SHALL work with ServerWebExchange in a reactive manner
3. WHEN the filter processes a request THEN it SHALL properly handle the reactive chain without blocking
4. WHEN an error occurs during routing THEN the filter SHALL handle it gracefully and return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to receive clear error messages when routing fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an id parameter is missing THEN the gateway SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with message "Missing required parameter: id"
2. WHEN an id parameter has an unknown prefix THEN the gateway SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with message "Unknown id prefix, expected 'user-' or 'product-'"
3. WHEN a backend service is unavailable THEN the gateway SHALL return a 503 Service Unavailable with appropriate error message
4. WHEN any routing error occurs THEN the response SHALL include proper HTTP status codes and JSON error format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the routing behavior to be configurable, so that I can modify service prefixes or add new services without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN routing prefixes SHALL be configurable via application properties
2. WHEN configuration changes THEN the new routing rules SHALL take effect without requiring code changes
3. WHEN adding a new service prefix THEN it SHALL be possible through configuration only
4. WHEN service URLs change THEN they SHALL be updatable through existing Spring Cloud Gateway configuration
