# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The gateway service currently has all Java classes in a single package (`com.example.gateway`), making it difficult to navigate and maintain as the codebase grows. This feature will reorganize the classes into logical packages following standard Spring Boot conventions to improve code organization, maintainability, and developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the gateway service classes organized into logical packages, so that I can easily find and maintain related functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing classes THEN the system SHALL group controller classes into a `controller` package
2. WHEN organizing classes THEN the system SHALL group configuration classes into a `config` package  
3. WHEN organizing classes THEN the system SHALL group client classes into a `client` package
4. WHEN organizing classes THEN the system SHALL group model/DTO classes into a `model` package
5. WHEN organizing classes THEN the system SHALL group exception handling classes into a `exception` package
6. WHEN organizing classes THEN the system SHALL group filter classes into a `filter` package

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements updated correctly, so that the application continues to work after the package restructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving classes to new packages THEN the system SHALL update all import statements in affected classes
2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL ensure no compilation errors occur
3. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package structure to follow Spring Boot conventions, so that new team members can easily understand the codebase organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating package structure THEN the system SHALL follow standard Spring Boot package naming conventions
2. WHEN organizing classes THEN the system SHALL place the main application class at the root package level
3. WHEN organizing classes THEN the system SHALL ensure related classes are grouped together logically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to continue working after the restructure, so that I can verify the refactoring didn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restructuring packages THEN the system SHALL update test class imports accordingly
2. WHEN running tests THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN updating test imports THEN the system SHALL maintain all test functionality
